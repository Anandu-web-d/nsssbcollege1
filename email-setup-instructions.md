# Email Setup Instructions

## Current Implementation

The email system is currently set up to log email notifications to the console. This is a simplified approach that works without external dependencies.

### How It Works
- Blood requests and contact form submissions are logged to the server console
- Email content is formatted and ready for integration with any email service
- The system is designed to be easily integrated with external email services

### Integration Options

#### Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended for quick setup)
1. Sign up at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Create an email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Get your service ID, template ID, and public key
4. Update the email functions in `lib/email.ts` to use EmailJS

#### Option 2: SendGrid
1. Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
2. Get your API key
3. Update the email functions to use SendGrid API

#### Option 3: Gmail SMTP (Advanced)
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
2. Generate an App Password
3. Install nodemailer: `npm install nodemailer @types/nodemailer`
4. Update the email configuration

## Email Features

### Blood Request Emails

## Testing
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Submit a blood request or contact form
3. Check the server console for the email notification logs
4. The email content will be displayed in the console with all the details

## Current Status
✅ **Blood Request System**: Fully functional with email notifications logged to console

2. Integrate the chosen service with the existing email functions
3. Test email delivery in production environment
4. Monitor email delivery and adjust as needed
